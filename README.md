# bucketeer-code-refs

Command line program for generating Bucketeer feature flag code references.

This repository provides solutions for configuring [Bucketeer code references](https://bucketeer.io) with various systems out-of-the-box, as well as the ability to automate code reference discovery on your own infrastructure using the provided command line interface.

## Execution via CLI

The command line program may be run manually, and executed in an environment of your choosing. The program requires your `git` repo to be cloned locally, and the currently checked out branch will be scanned for code references.

We recommend incorporating `bucketeer-code-refs` into your CI/CD build process. `bucketeer-code-refs` should run whenever a commit is pushed to your repository.

### Prerequisites

If you are scanning a git repository, `bucketeer-code-refs` requires git (tested with version 2.21.0) to be installed on the system path.
